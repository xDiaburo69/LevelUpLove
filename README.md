# LevelUpLove - Dating App

 LevelUpLove is a small team project developed during a vocational training program.  
 It is designed as a simple but functional dating application that allows users to register, create profiles, find matches, and communicate via chat.

 The project is divided into two parts:

- **Backend** is fully developed and maintained by Diaburo.
- **Frontend** is created and styled by Madame Parker.

 The main purpose of this project is not only to create a working web application, but also to gain practical experience in building and connecting backend and frontend systems in a realistic development workflow.  

 Through this project, we aim to strengthen our understanding of professional software development. We focus on topics such as authentication, database communication, real-time messaging, clean API design, API communication and user interface development. This project serves as a valuable step towards working on real-world applications in a collaborative team environment.
